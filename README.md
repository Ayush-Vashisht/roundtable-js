**Surveys are a _craft_**. They are the gateways to new information. *How* you ask determines *what* you receive.

Whether you're conducting market research, gathering academic data, or measuring customer satisfaction, Roundtable gives you the tools to ask the right questions, in the right way, to get the answers you need.

## üåü Features

- **Designed for the Modern Web:** We‚Äôre designed in JavaScript and leverage its asynchronous functionality for managing survey logic. For example, rather than determining this logic based on callbacks that trigger when a page is submitted, our library builds the timeline in an async function which means the logic flows intuitively from top to bottom. 

- **AI-Native Functionality:** Our cloud offering has AI-native features such as natural language programming and automated fraud detection. We‚Äôre continuously expanding our AI features. Let us know what tools you‚Äôd like to see!

- **Developer-Friendly:** We are open-source and API-first. This problem arose by seeing how difficult it was to integrate our API into other survey softwares. We want the open-source offering to include a robust plugin ecosystem where people can introduce new question types, integrate with tools like CRMs, and control how data is stored and processed. 

## üöÄ Quick Start

## Installation

### Option 1: npm

1. Install Roundtable.js using npm:
   ```
   npm install roundtable-js@beta
   ```

### Option 2: Git

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/roundtableAI/roundtable-js.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd roundtable-js
   ```

3. Include the necessary files in your project.

## Usage

1. Import the necessary modules in your JavaScript file:

   ```javascript
   import Survey from 'roundtable-js/core/survey.js';
   import SingleSelect from 'roundtable-js/question_types/singleSelect.js';
   ```

2. Create a survey instance and add pages with questions:

   ```javascript
   // Define an asynchronous function to run the survey
   async function runSurvey() {

         // Create a new Survey instance with a specific participant ID
         const survey = new Survey({ participantId: 'participant_123' });

         // Define the first question as a single-select question with two options
         const question1 = new SingleSelect({
            id: 'question1',
            text: 'A question',
            options: ['Option 1', 'Option 2'],
         });

         // Define the second question as a single-select question with two options
         const question2 = new SingleSelect({
            id: 'question2',
            text: 'A second question',
            options: ['Option 1', 'Option 2'],
         });
         
         // Show the first page with the first question and wait for it to be answered
         await survey.showPage({ id: 'page1', elements: [question1] });
         
         // This code runs only after the first page is completed
         console.log('Page 1 completed');
         
         // Show the next page with the second question and wait for it to be answered
         await survey.showPage({ id: 'page2', elements: [question2] });
         
         // Finish the survey once all pages are completed
         survey.finishSurvey();
      }

      // Start the survey by calling the runSurvey function
      runSurvey();
   ```

3. Set up your HTML:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
         <meta charset="UTF-8">
         <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
         <title>RoundtableJS Survey</title>
   </head>
   <body>
         <div id="survey-container"></div>
         <script type="module" src="your-survey-script.js"></script>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```
